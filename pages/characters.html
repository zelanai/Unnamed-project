    <h3>Leah</h3>

    <img src="../images/leah_headshot.png"alt="two sketched headshots of Leah"height="auto" width="500">

    <p>
        Leah is an upbeat, positive girl who's ready to take on the world and become an adventurer! She wants to help anyone in need and prove to her parents that she can make a name for herself as a hero.
    </p>

    <h3>Rowan</h3>

    <h3>Finn</h3>

    <h3>Sylvie</h3>

    <p>Sylvie seems to hate the world, making the worst of every situation. She's a seasoned adventurer, having been a member of the illustrious Flaming Shield Adventuring Co. but has little love for the craft these days. 
        Despite her cynical outlook, Sylvie is always there to help the wounded with a potion or poultice of her own creation, refusing to leave a person in need when she can help.
